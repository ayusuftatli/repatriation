Africa is a significant origin of irregular migration, playing a crucial role in global policy discussions. A key concern within these debates is the effectiveness of return orders issued to individuals and their subsequent compliance in returning to their home countries.

The primary objective of this assignment is to visually represent the number of people who were instructed to return to their countries by EU nations, as well as those who actually complied with these orders, with a focus on sub-regional data. I want to answer three questions:

1. Which regions have the highest number of return orders and actual returns between the years of 2013 and 2022?
2. Which year has the highest return rate?
3. Which region has the highest return rate in 2022?

To accomplish this, I utilised two datasets from Eurostat: ["Third Country Nationals Ordered to Leave"](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/MIGR_EIORD/default/table?lang=en&category=migr.migr_man.migr_eil) and ["Third Country Nationals Returned Following an Order to Leave."](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/MIGR_EIRTN/default/table?lang=en) In this project, I aim to create visualisations that can be utilised to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics and outcomes of return policies within the African context.
